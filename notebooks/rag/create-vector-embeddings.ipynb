      "Manhattan Associates develops modern commerce solutions that help its customers in three distinct areas of their business: \n",
      "\n",
      "•\n",
      "Supply Chain Execution - We provide companies the tools needed to manage distribution and optimize transportation costs throughout their entire commercial network. Manhattan’s Warehouse Management solutions are widely regarded as industry-leading systems designed to optimize productivity and throughput in distribution centers and warehouses around the world. Our software helps optimize fulfillment models to support our customers across a wide range of channels and fulfillment methods. Likewise, we design our offerings to provide shippers and carriers the most comprehensive transportation management solutions in the market. This includes software to help them move freight via the most cost-effective means possible while also meeting service-level expectations, to model their transportation network, and to automate the procurement-to-pay process.\n",
      "•\n",
      "Omnichannel Commerce - Meeting ever-evolving consumer expectations of service, inventory availability, and delivery convenience is a challenge every merchant must meet head on. Manhattan’s Omnichannel solutions provide an operating platform for digital commerce, retailers, and wholesale businesses. Comprising Order Management, Store Inventory Fulfillment, Call Center, Point of Sale (POS), and Customer Engagement as their core applications, Manhattan Omnichannel solutions provide CRM capabilities for contact center agents; end-to-end process enablement for store associates, and enterprise-wide inventory availability determination, order fulfillment optimization, and POS capabilities. \n",
      "•\n",
      "Supply Chain Planning – Manhattan’s solutions provide distributors of finished goods (apparel, food, auto parts, pharmaceuticals, etc.) the ability to forecast demand, determine when, where and how much inventory is needed, and translate this into profitable inventory buying plans. These areas are ever more complex and critical to profitability as more wholesalers and retailers engage in omnichannel operations. Through the use of advanced science and sophisticated analytics, customer service level is maximized with minimum inventory investment. Industry changes driven by omnichannel retail, pharmaceutical regulations and other trends make this an area of particular need for many retailers and wholesale distributors.\n",
      "Manhattan Associates’ Software Solution Portfolios \n",

      "Industry Leading Feature Function – Manhattan solutions are consistently rated by customers and industry analysts alike as providing the most comprehensive and innovative feature functionality in the market. From warehouse management to POS, our solutions are consistently at the top of the market with respect to configurability, capability and usability. Customers choose Manhattan applications to solve the industry’s most complex supply chain problems. Our combination of deep domain expertise, an in-house data science and operations research team, and a specialized user experience team combine to differentiate Manhattan solutions.\n",
      "•\n",
      "Solution Unification – Manhattan solutions are organized into three groups: omni-channel, supply chain, and inventory. Each one of these groups are engineered to provide cross-application benefit that simplifies and improves operations within those three areas. This approach significantly reduces complexity, maintenance and application risk for our customers, providing an expanded set of end-to-end capabilities. As complexity continues to grow for our customers, Manhattan provides value by eliminating the need to design, build and maintain complex system to system integration.\n",
      "Manhattan’s Supply Chain Solutions are focused on the distribution and transportation operations of the enterprise. There are two main components of Manhattan’s Supply Chain Solutions:\n",

      "•\n",
      "Distribution Management - These applications comprise Manhattan’s Warehouse Management Solutions (WMS) commonly used to manage the complexity of the modern distribution center. WMS manages the flow of goods and information across the distribution center. WMS is delivered for new and upgrading customers in the form of Manhattan Active Warehouse Management (MAWM), a cloud native and versionless application that delivers new innovation on a quarterly basis. Manhattan Active WM runs on Google Cloud Platform, is offered exclusively via subscription, and includes state of the art fulfillment optimization technology, a consumer grade mobile app experience for the associate, and embedded gamification capabilities to improve associate engagement and performance. Manhattan Active WM is fully configurable and technically extensible, meaning customers can build their own componentry to work alongside our base application. Manhattan Active WM also embeds labor management and slotting optimization capabilities. Manhattan’s WMS customers benefit from its embedded warehouse execution system that coordinates the interaction between automation, robotics and labor for maximum efficiency. Manhattan’s WMS also enables the efficient utilization of a single distribution center for direct-to-consumer, retail replenishment and high-volume wholesale fulfilment. Our WMS provides the customer the most productive operation that can scale to meet the highest demands during peak season while operating effectively and profitably throughout the course of the year.\n",
      "•\n",
      "Transportation Management - Organizations today face a complex transportation environment with ever-changing demands driven by macro-economic trends and governmental regulations. Manhattan’s Transportation Management Solutions (TMS) are designed to help shippers navigate their way through these demands while meeting customer service expectations at the lowest possible freight costs. TMS components include procurement and modeling tools to setup a successful network, along with planning, execution and settlement tools to manage day-to-day transportation requirements. Our TMS can also connect shippers with a network of partners that can increase shipping capacity on an as-needed basis. Manhattan Carrier is a suite of solutions built specifically to help motor carriers optimize load assignments, minimize fuel costs, manage drivers’ hours of service and accommodate demand fluctuations. \n",

      "\n",
      "SCALE is our portfolio of logistics execution solutions built on Microsoft’s .NET® platform. Purpose-built for rapid development and a value-based total cost of ownership, SCALE is targeted toward companies with execution-focused supply chain needs that require speed-to-value, resource-light system configuration and maintenance, and the ability to quickly scale their logistics operations up or down in response to market fluctuations or business requirement changes. SCALE combines the features of Trading Partner Management, Yard Management, Optimization, Warehouse Management and Transportation Execution. \n",
      "\n",
      "Because SCALE solutions leverage a common platform, they share common data elements, and each user can access all applications through a single sign-on. Users also can set up “dashboards” that enable easy access to real-time information most relevant to their jobs. SCALE’s ease of deployment, operation and support make it a popular choice for organizations operating in countries with emerging and developing economies, and where technical support resources are limited.\n",
      "\n",
      "SCALE is delivered as a cloud-based solution on Microsoft’s Azure platform. Through this platform, Manhattan Active SCALE customers receive new capability on an annual basis and enjoy full configurability and elements of technical extensibility even when delivered on Azure.

      "Omnichannel Solutions \n",
      "\n",
      "As omnichannel retail has placed new demands on retailers, it has also created new software solution needs. These range from the ability to leverage inventory across the entire network to meet any demand, to providing store associates and call center representatives the means to take advantage of the available inventory. Our Manhattan Active Omni set of solutions brings together Order Management, Store Inventory & Fulfillment, POS and Customer Engagement tools into a single application built on a shared, cloud-native, microservices platform. This architecture enables our customers to more easily expand their systems to include more capabilities and quarterly product enhancements while always maintaining their customizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "•\n",
      "Enterprise Omnichannel Solutions - There is a wide range of new capabilities that must be leveraged at a corporate or ‘central’ level in retail today to enable best-in-class customer service, full inventory visibility, direct to client distribution and seamless fulfillment operations. Our goal is to enable an omnichannel commerce platform that can be tapped into by any selling system—such as webstore, ERP, point-of-sale, call center, and mobile app, to more cost-effectively promise and then meet delivery dates. Manhattan’s Enterprise Inventory builds out a complete inventory availability picture that can be updated in near-real time with feeds from the warehouse, the store and other fulfillment locations in the network. Enterprise Order Management merges this inventory availability data with demand feeds from across the organization to match supply with demand - satisfying customer delivery expectations while striving to maximize revenue and profitability. Finally, Manhattan offers a unique Customer Engagement solution that enables contact center associates to see a holistic view of the customer, including a complete customer sales and interaction history, to better satisfy shopper needs while optimizing potential revenue \n",

      "•\n",
      "Omnichannel Solutions for the Store - As the consumer enters the store with more information than ever, it is vital to equip the sales associate with relevant information and capabilities to satisfy their demands. Store solutions available on mobile and fixed stations include POS to process purchase transactions and Customer Engagement to provide the associate with a complete picture of the shopper’s purchase history. Manhattan brings these solutions together on a single mobile platform to enable retailers to offer unparalleled service and convenience for the shopper.  \n",
      "•\n",
      "Store Inventory and Fulfillment - Most retailers are now looking to leverage store inventory to fulfill e-commerce demand (driving greater sales revenue with less inventory). This requires solutions that can accurately maintain inventory integrity and enable productive, reliable fulfillment. Manhattan’s Store Fulfillment solutions provide store associates with capabilities that power fulfillment experiences like buy online, pickup in store, curbside pickup, same day delivery and ship from store.\n",
      "Inventory Solutions \n",
      "\n",
      "The ability to accurately forecast demand and project inventory needs is heightened by omnichannel retail requirements that change traditional approaches to inventory management. Manhattan’s Inventory solutions address which products should be carried and the quantity that will be needed at each location by date.\n",
      "\n",
      "•\n",
      "Inventory Optimization - This set of applications includes sophisticated demand forecasting capabilities that can address the particularly challenging slow-moving and intermittent products that frequently result in excess inventory due to unpredictability. Also included is the Replenishment module that can evaluate inventory needs across all locations and channels. This module can even suggest transferring inventory between locations (warehouses or stores) or ‘protect’ merchandise at a store from online sales to save it for walk-in traffic. \n",
      "•\n",
      "Allocation – Manhattan’s Allocation is designed to serve the softlines/apparel market. It provides inventory planning capabilities from first receipt in the distribution center through to the end of season for a given assortment. Built on the Manhattan Active architecture, Manhattan Active Allocation is cloud native, versionless, runs on Google Cloud Platform and updated on a quarterly basis.   \n",
      "Technology Platform\n",
      "\n",
      "Manhattan's Active Platform solutions are cloud-native products designed to provide “always current” version-less product access. The server side full stack runs exclusively on Google Cloud Platform, and end users can access the system from almost any type of device – mobile, tablet or desktop. Manhattan Active solutions are sold directly in multi-year cloud subscription arrangements, typically for a period of five years or more, providing clients with regular software updates during the contract period to ensure access to the latest product features and benefiting Manhattan with a predictable and regular revenue stream. \n",
      "\n",
      "Part of the key value proposition of Manhattan Active Platform is extensibility. In addition to the business configurability offered within each line of business application, Manhattan Active Platform also allows our customers to change the underlying data model, the user interface, and the core business logic within each application. Key to this process is Manhattan ProActive, our developer enablement toolkit which allows for the types of technical modifications noted above (and more). While we don’t charge separately for Manhattan ProActive (it comes as part of the subscription to any Manhattan Active Platform application), we do enhance it on the same cadence as we do our line of business application, i.e. quarterly. \n",
      "\n",
      "As omnichannel and supply chain solutions necessarily interact with other business operation systems, our solutions are designed to interoperate with software from other providers as well as with a customer's existing legacy systems. This interfacing and open system capability enables customers to continue using existing computer resources and to choose among a wide variety of existing and emerging computer hardware and peripheral technologies. We also offer certain solutions in either on-premise software or cloud computing models so that customers can select the option that best meets their requirements for control, flexibility, cost of ownership and time-to-deployment.\n",
      "\n",
      "We continually invest in artificial intelligence (AI) technology to enhance our functional offerings, with a recent emphasis on generative AI (GenAI) advancements. Our AI capabilities are seamlessly embedded across all supply chain execution, planning, and commerce applications, aimed at delivering real-time optimization and value creation. Historically, our AI initiatives have focused on traditional mathematical optimization and machine learning. However, we are now leveraging third-party large language models to unlock value in a broader range of use cases. Looking ahead, we plan to further expand our investments in generative AI, introducing new product capabilities in the coming quarters and years. These efforts are designed to empower supply chain operators, retailers, and end consumers with GenAI-driven assistance. We expect our continuing focus on innovation to generate ongoing productivity gains, enhanced user experiences, and increased operational efficiencies.\n",

      "Customers \n",
      "\n",
      "To date, our customers have been suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and logistics providers in a variety of industries. Our top five customers (new or pre-existing) in the aggregate accounted for 12%, 11%, and 11% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, the year ended December 31, 2023, and the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n",

      "Product Development \n",
      "\n",
      "We focus our development efforts on new product innovation and on adding new functionality to existing solutions; integrating our various solution offerings; and enhancing the operability of our solutions across our platforms. We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to enhance existing solutions, respond to dynamically changing customer requirements and develop new or enhanced solutions that incorporate new technological developments and emerging supply chain and industry standards. To that end, development frequently focuses on base system enhancements and incorporating new user requirements and features into our solutions. As a result, we deliver packaged, highly configurable solutions with increasingly rich functionality rather than custom-developed software.\n",
      "\n",
      "We leverage internal and external scientific advisors to inform our solution strategies and research and development approaches with the most advanced thinking on supply chain opportunities, challenges and technologies. Our internal research team is comprised of Ph.D.-credentialed math and science experts who work on creating and solving algorithms and other constructs that advance the optimization capabilities and other aspects of our solutions. We also regularly communicate with and are advised by experts from leading educational institutions known for their supply chain disciplines and practitioners from organizations deploying supply chain technology in innovative and market-advancing ways. Together, our research team and external advisors inform both the practical business approaches and the mathematical and scientific inventiveness of our solutions. \n",
      "\n",
      "We conduct most research and development internally in the U.S. and India to retain domain knowledge and promote programming continuity standards. However, we may periodically outsource some projects that can be performed separately or that require special skills. We also use third-party translation companies to localize our application software into various languages including Chinese, French, Japanese and Spanish. \n",

      "Competition \n",
      "\n",

      "The principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our solutions include: industry expertise; company and solution reputation; company viability; compliance with industry standards; solution architecture; solution functionality and features; integration experience, particularly with enterprise resource planning (ERP) providers and material handling equipment providers; ease and speed of implementation; proven return on investment; historical and current solution quality and performance; total cost of ownership; solution price; and ongoing solution support structure. We believe we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our competitors are diverse and offer a variety of solutions directed at various aspects of enterprise commerce. Existing competitors include: \n",
      "\n",
      "•\n",
      "Corporate information technology departments of current or potential customers capable of internally developing solutions; \n",
      "•\n",
      "ERP vendors, including: Oracle, SAP and Infor, among others; \n",
      "•\n",
      "Supply chain execution and planning vendors, including Blue Yonder/Panasonic (formerly JDA), Korber (formerly HighJump), SAS Institute, the Sterling Commerce division of IBM, Relex, and others; \n",
      "•\n",
      "POS vendors, including Aptos, Oracle, and others; and\n",
      "•\n",
      "Smaller independent companies that have developed or are attempting to develop supply chain execution solutions or planning solutions that apply either globally or in specific countries. \n",
      "We anticipate ongoing competition from ERP and supply chain management (SCM) applications vendors and from business application software vendors that may broaden their solution offerings by internally developing or acquiring or partnering with independent developers of supply chain planning and execution software. Some of these ERP and other potential competitors have longer operating histories; significantly more financial, technical, marketing and other resources; greater name recognition; broader solutions; and larger installed bases of customers than us. To the extent that ERP and SCM vendors or other large competitors develop or acquire systems with functionality comparable or superior to ours, their larger customer bases, long-standing customer relationships and ability to offer broader solutions outside the scope of supply chain could create significant competitive advantage for them. It also is possible that new competitors or alliances among current or new competitors could emerge to win significant market share. Increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced earnings and margins and loss of market share. In turn, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We believe we have established meaningful competitive differentiation through our supply chain and omnichannel commerce expertise; our platform-based solution approach; our track record of continuous supply chain commerce innovation and investment; our strong and endorsing customer relationships; our significant success in deploying and supporting supply chain, inventory and omnichannel solutions for market-leading companies; our success in helping our clients address the enterprise impacts of digital commerce; and our ability to out-execute others in identifying sales opportunities and demonstrating expertise throughout the sales cycle. However, to further our market success, we must continue to respond promptly and effectively to economic consumption models such as cloud subscription, technological change and competitors’ innovations. Consequently, we cannot assure that we will not be required to make substantial additional investments in research, development, marketing, sales and customer service efforts in order to meet any competitive threat, or that we will be able to compete successfully in the future. \n",

      "We have three reportable segments based on geographic location: North and Latin America (“the Americas”); Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia Pacific (“APAC”). For further information on our segments, see Note 8 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. International revenue includes all revenue derived from sales to customers outside the United States. At December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 2,750 employees in our international operations. \n",

      "We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trade secret, trademark and trade dress laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights in our products, processes and technology. We have registered trademarks for Manhattan Associates and the Manhattan Associates logo, as well as a number of our products and features. Generally, we enter into confidentiality and assignment-of-rights agreements with our employees, consultants, customers and potential customers and limit access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information. We provide our SaaS services and license our proprietary products to our customers under services contracts and license agreements that we believe contain appropriate use and other restrictions in order to try to best protect our ownership of our services and products and our proprietary rights and to protect our revenue potential. However, despite our efforts to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights, we cannot ensure that we will successfully deter misappropriation, unintended disclosure or independent third-party development of our technology or our proprietary rights or information.

      "unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and, while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software solutions exists, as is the case with any software company, piracy could become a problem. Further, to the extent that we enter into transactions in countries where intellectual property laws are not well developed or are poorly enforced, our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may be ineffective. Whether we seek to enforce our proprietary rights in the U.S. or abroad, our efforts, including litigation to enforce our rights, can result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, and such efforts, or our failure to succeed in such efforts, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, regardless of the final outcome. \n",
      "\n",
      "As the number of supply chain management solutions available in the marketplace increases and solution functionality continues to overlap, supply chain software may increasingly become subject to claims of infringement or other misappropriation of intellectual property. Third parties may assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us relating to our products, processes or technology. Such claims, whether or not they have merit, generally are time-consuming and may result in costly litigation, divert management’s attention or cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements. Defense of infringement or other misappropriation claims, entering into royalty or licensing agreements, the unavailability of such agreements, or adverse determinations in proprietary rights litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. \n",

      "At Manhattan, employees are our most-valued asset and are the key to our success. We have offices in Australia, Chile, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as representatives in Mexico and reseller partnerships in Latin America, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, South Africa, and Asia. As of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 4,690 employees worldwide.\n",

      "Equal Employment Opportunity: Our workforce is highly educated and diverse, which we believe is important for our continued success as a leading innovator in supply chain and omnichannel commerce software and services. Our employees comprise software developers, engineers, and other technical workers and professionals in business operations and administration. Manhattan’s PRISMTM embodies our long-standing global inclusion strategy and is driven by team members with a passion for creating an innovative and inclusive environment. It brings our many cultures together to form a collective brilliance in an environment where individuals from all backgrounds and experiences can feel comfortable as themselves. Through PRISM, we support employee resource groups (ERGs), such as our Multicultural Network (MCNTM). We also have a dedicated learning path for all employees regarding the importance of equal employment opportunity and career development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Talent Acquisition, Retention, and Engagement: We employ several strategies for attracting, retaining, and engaging our talented workforce. To build a steady and diverse pipeline of talent, we have a robust in-house recruiting program, which includes campus recruiting focused on colleges and universities with leading supply chain, engineering, and computer science programs. Further, promote diverse candidate pools, including individuals with disabilities and veterans, and through recruiting efforts at HBCUs and schools with a high percentage of women and minorities enrolled in engineering and computer science programs.\n",

      "To attract and retain employees, we provide competitive compensation and benefits programs, employee recognition, career development opportunities, and access to continual growth through online learning platforms, external training, and in-house live training. \n",
      "\n",
      "To further employee enrichment and engagement, we periodically survey our employees regarding their engagement levels. We use these survey results to determine how we can continue to create work environments that enable and energize our employees and to develop a positive culture. None of our U.S. employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement; our employees in both France (approximately 190 employees) and the Netherlands (approximately 100 employees) are represented by employee works councils. Globally, we have experienced no work stoppages, and we believe our relations with our employees are strong.\n",

      "Risks Related to Our Business\n",
      "\n",
      "Our future revenue is dependent on continuing sales from cloud subscriptions, which in turn drive sales of professional services. We are dependent on our new customers as well as our large installed customer base to purchase additional cloud subscriptions and professional services from us. In future periods customers may discontinue the cloud subscriptions and in turn may not purchase additional professional services from us. If our customers decide to discontinue the cloud subscription, or if they reduce the scope of their professional services agreements, our revenue could decrease significantly, and that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "We depend on third-party data centers to provide our cloud-based solutions. If these providers encounter defects, delays or interruptions in service, our business and operating results could be harmed. Furthermore, if we are unable to manage the costs of these services, our results may be negatively affected. We utilize data center hosting facilities, which are managed by third parties, to provide cloud solutions and hosting services to our customers. If the third-party data center facilities fail or encounter any damage, it could result in interruptions in services to our customers. This could result in unanticipated downtime for our customers, and in turn, our reputation and business could be adversely affected. In addition, if our customers use our cloud arrangements in unanticipated ways, this could cause an interruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our data center providers may experience events such as natural disasters, weather events, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, or similar events. The systems, infrastructure, and services of our data center providers may also be subject to human or software errors, viruses, cyber threats, fraud, spikes in customer usage, break-ins, sabotage, acts of vandalism, acts of terrorism, and other misconduct. In addition, they may experience other unanticipated problems, including but not limited to financial difficulties and bankruptcy. Further, we may experience in the future periodic interruptions, delays, and outages in service and availability with our data center providers due to a variety of factors, including Internet connectivity failures, infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions, and capacity constraints. \n",
      "\n",
      "13\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Remediation of any service interruptions may take significant time. If any defects, delays or interruption in our cloud solutions occur, customers could elect to cancel their service, delay or withhold payment to us, not purchase from us in the future or make claims against us, which could adversely affect our business reputation, results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, our data center providers have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew agreements with them on commercially reasonable terms, if our agreements with our providers are prematurely terminated for any reason, or if our providers are acquired or cease business, we may be required to transfer our infrastructure to new public cloud facilities, and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruptions in connection with doing so. Renewals at higher prices or costs incurred in switching providers may negatively affect our profitability and results. In addition, consolidation in the data center industry may result in overall higher costs for such services, which could also negatively affect our profitability and results.\n",
      "\n",
      "Delays in implementing our products could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition. Due to the size and complexity of most of our software implementations, our implementation cycle can be lengthy and may result in delays. Our products may require modification or customization and must integrate with many existing computer systems and software programs of our customers. This can be time-consuming and expensive for customers and can result in implementation and deployment delays of our products. Additional delays could result if we fail to attract, train, and retain services personnel, or if our alliance companies fail to commit sufficient resources towards implementing our software. These delays and resulting customer dissatisfaction could limit our future sales opportunities, harm our reputation, and adversely impact results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our liability to clients may be substantial if our systems fail, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition. Our products are often critical to the operations of our customers’ businesses and provide benefits that may be difficult to quantify. If our products fail to function as required—which, as described in more detail in other risk factors, could be due to software bugs, cloud hosting service failures, security breaches, faulty implementations or other reasons—we may be subject to claims for substantial damages. Courts may not enforce provisions in our contracts that would limit our liability or otherwise protect us from liability for damages. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert management’s time and attention. Although we maintain general liability insurance and error and omissions coverage, these coverages may not continue to be available on reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts to cover claims against us. In addition, our insurer may disclaim coverage as to any future claim. If claims exceeding the available insurance coverage are successfully asserted against us, or our insurer imposes premium increases or large deductibles or co-insurance requirements on us, then our business, results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition could be adversely affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our ability to sell our cloud solutions is highly dependent on the quality of our services offerings, and our failure to offer high quality services could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition. Most of our customers rely to some extent on our professional services to aid in the implementation of our software solutions. Once our software has been installed and deployed, our customers may depend on us to provide them with ongoing support and resolution of issues relating to our software. Therefore, a high level of service is critical for the continued marketing and sale of our solutions. If we or our partners do not efficiently and effectively install and deploy our software products, or succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues, our ability to sell software products to these customers would be adversely affected and our reputation in the marketplace with potential customers could suffer. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our use of generative artificial intelligence (“AI”) tools may expose us to operational, compliance or other risks, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition, and subject us to legal liability. We use generative AI tools in our business for external purposes (e.g., as additional features to our software products) and for internal purposes (e.g., to support our operations and improve the day-to-day performance of our employees), and these tools are mostly developed and marketed by third-party vendors.\n",
      "\n",
      "We seek to ensure that our use of AI tools in support of our operations and business is carried out in a secure, ethical and lawful manner. We have a global “AI Tools Policy” in place that applies to the use of AI tools by all of our employees and contractors and that provides guidelines for a responsible use of AI within the Company. We also have a cross-functional governance organization (which includes members of our IT security and legal teams) with a mission to oversee the use of AI within the Company and assess and mitigate the risks that may be related to this use. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, because the use of generative AI tools in business environments is a relatively novel development, the extent of benefits, risks, and liabilities attached to it are still unknown. We have identified the following main risks related to our use of AI tools:\n",
      "\n",
      "•\n",
      "Protection of our proprietary rights. Our developers may use, in limited instances, generative AI tools to support their computer code writing activities for our proprietary software products. According to recent decisions of governmental entities and courts (such as the U.S. Copyright Office and U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit), U.S. copyright is limited to protecting works created by human authors. Many other jurisdictions around the world follow the same approach. \n",
      "14\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "We may therefore face challenges in obtaining U.S. copyright or other intellectual property rights worldwide on certain parts of our products that were developed using generative AI tools (for further information regarding this risk, see the risk factor entitled “Our failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition”).\n",
      "•\n",
      "AI adoption-related risk. As we include generative AI features in our software products, some of our customers, especially those in highly regulated industries, may be reluctant or unwilling to use generative AI products. Accordingly, their reluctance to do so could reduce or delay customer adoption, and this may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n",
      "•\n",
      "Operational risks. Our use of third-party generative AI tools exposes us to greater risks related to the quality of our products (for further information regarding this risk, see the risk factor entitled “Our ability to sell our cloud solutions is highly dependent on the quality of our services offerings, and our failure to offer high quality services could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition”). For example:\n",
      "•\n",
      "Generative AI features embedded in our software products may create incomplete or inaccurate outputs and this could result in customer dissatisfaction or potential claims related to product performance (for further information regarding this risk, see the risk factor entitled “Our software may contain undetected errors or “bugs” causing harm to our reputation, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition”);\n",
      "•\n",
      "Our use of third-party generative AI tools to power features of our software products may impair our ability to correct defects or cure unavailability in a timely manner because we have no control over our third-party vendors’ operations and infrastructure (for further information regarding this risk, see the risk factor entitled “We incorporate third-party software in our solutions, the failure or unavailability of which could adversely affect our ability to sell, support, and service our products”).\n",
      "•\n",
      "Cybersecurity and Third-Party Rights. Generally, because we mainly use generative AI tools that are developed by third-party vendors, we have lesser control over the further use or distribution of any content we may share or create via these third-party tools. In addition, the vendors of these tools may fail to comply with their contractual obligations to us, or not provide warranties, indemnities or other remedies, regarding the confidentiality or security of this content. Further, our use of generative AI tools to generate computer code may present additional security risks because the generated source code may contain security vulnerabilities. As a result, our sensitive information or that of our employees or customers could be leaked or disclosed, or other IT security incidents may arise (for further information regarding this risk, see the risk factor entitled “If our data protection or other security measures are compromised and, as a result, our data, our customers’ data or our IT systems are accessed improperly, made unavailable, or improperly modified, our products and services may be perceived as vulnerable…”). In addition, we have little insight into, and no control over, the content used or provided by third-party vendors to train their generative AI tools. For example, there is ongoing litigation over whether the use of copyrighted materials to train AI models is lawful, however the impact of its outcome on our ability to use certain generative AI tools is unknown.\n",
      "•\n",
      "Regulatory risks. Several jurisdictions around the globe, including in Europe and the U.S. (at state and federal level), have proposed or already enacted legislative frameworks governing the development, use and marketing of AI tools, including the European Union’s AI Act and the Colorado AI Act. We expect other jurisdictions will adopt similar regulations. Additionally, certain privacy laws may apply to our use of generative AI tools (such as a data subject’s right to have a precise view of how their personal data are processed). These legal requirements may make it harder for us to conduct our business using AI (especially third-party AI tools), lead to regulatory fines or penalties, require us to change our business practices, or prevent or limit our use of AI tools, which in turn, may lead our business to be less efficient, or us to be at a competitive disadvantage (for further information regarding this risk, see the risk factor entitled “Our technology must be advanced if we are to remain competitive”). \n",
      "Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage, and, if not addressed, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our pricing models may need to be modified due to price competition. The competitive markets in which we operate may oblige us to reduce our prices in order to contend with the pricing models of our competitors. If our competitors discount certain products or services, we may have to lower prices on certain products or services in order to attract or retain customers. Any such price modifications would likely reduce margins and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "15\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "We may encounter long sales cycles, particularly with our larger customers, which could have an adverse effect on the amount, timing, and predictability of our revenue, adversely affecting our business, results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition. Our products have lengthy sales cycles, which typically extend from nine to twelve months and may take up to several years. Potential and existing customers, particularly larger enterprise customers, often commit significant resources to an evaluation of available solutions and services and require us to expend substantial time and resources in connection with our sales efforts. The length of our sales cycles also varies depending on the type of customer to which we are selling, the product being sold, and customer requirements. We may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort during this time, regardless of whether we make a sale. Many of the key risks relating to sales processes are beyond our control, including: our customers’ budgetary and scheduling constraints; the timing of our customers’ budget cycles and approval processes; our customers’ willingness to replace their currently deployed software solutions; and general economic conditions. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a result of these lengthy and uncertain sales cycles of our products and services, it is difficult for us to predict when customers may purchase products or services from us, thereby affecting when we can recognize the associated revenue, and our operating results may vary significantly and may be adversely affected. The length of our sales cycle makes us susceptible to having pending transactions delayed or terminated by our customers if they decide to delay or withdraw funding for IT projects. Our customers may decide to delay or withdraw funding for IT projects for various reasons, including, but not limited to, global economic cycles and capital market fluctuations. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our technology must be advanced if we are to remain competitive. The market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, changes in customer demands, and evolving industry standards. Our existing products could be rendered obsolete if we fail to continue to advance our technology. We have also found that the technological life cycles of our products are difficult to estimate, partially because of changing demands of other participants in the supply chain. We believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to continue to enhance our current product line while we concurrently develop and introduce new products that keep pace with competitive and technological developments. These developments require us to continue to make substantial product development investments. Although we are presently developing a number of product enhancements to our product sets, we cannot assure you that these enhancements will be completed on a timely basis or gain customer acceptance. \n",
      "\n",

Our largest market, retail, is experiencing significant business disruption and transformation, primarily driven by digital commerce. We believe that disruption is causing many traditional retailers to assess the challenges of the transformation and evaluate their store networks and costs, as they face increasing competitive pressures from e-commerce retailers. Since our solutions often require our customers to make significant capital investments, traditional retailers could delay purchase decisions on our products.

      "Global macro-economic trends, technology spending, and supply chain management market growth are important barometers for our business. In 2024, we generated approximately 67% of our total revenue in the United States, 18% in EMEA, and the remaining balance in APAC, Canada, and Latin America. In addition, Gartner Inc. (“Gartner”), an information technology research and advisory company, estimates that over 75% of every supply chain software solutions dollar invested is spent in North America and Europe; consequently, the health of the U.S. and European economies have a meaningful impact on our financial results. \n",
      "\n",
      "We sell technology-based solutions with total pricing, including software and services, in many cases exceeding $1.0 million. Our software is often a part of our customers’ and prospects’ much larger capital commitment associated with facilities expansion and business improvement. We believe that, given the mission critical nature of our software, combined with a challenging global macro environment, our current sales cycles for large cloud subscriptions in our target markets could be extended. While demand for our solutions is solid, the current business climate within the United States and geographic regions in which we operate may affect customers’ and prospects’ decisions regarding timing of strategic capital expenditures. \n",
      "\n",
      "In January 2025, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) provided a World Economic Outlook (WEO) update. The WEO update noted, “Global growth is projected at 3.3 percent both in 2025 and 2026, below the historical (2000–19) average of 3.7 percent. Global headline inflation is expected to decline to 4.2 percent in 2025 and to 3.5 percent in 2026, converging back to target earlier in advanced economies than in emerging market and developing economies.”  \n",

Total cloud revenue increased from $176.5 million in 2022 to $254.6 million in 2023, representing a 44% year-over-year increase.

Over 98% of our RPO represent cloud native subscriptions with a non-cancelable term greater than one year. Maintenance contracts typically are for one year and not included in RPO. RPO provides insight into our contracted backlog of future business. As of December 31, 2024, our RPO was approximately $1.8 billion, an increase of 25% over December 31, 2023 on strong demand.\n",

In 2024, cloud subscriptions revenue totaled $337.2 million, or 32% of total revenue. The Americas, EMEA, and APAC segments recognized $264.3 million, $62.8 million and $10.1 million in cloud subscriptions revenue, respectively, in 2024. Cloud subscriptions revenue is recognized over the term of the agreement, typically five years or more. Cloud subscription revenue growth is influenced by the strength of general economic and business conditions and the competitive position of our software products. These revenues generally have long sales cycles. Approximately 22% of the total value of new non-cancelable cloud subscriptions (excluding renewals) signed during 2024 was with new customers and 78% was with existing customers. We define new customers as entities from which we either have never earned revenue or have not recognized revenue in the last five years.\n",

We are a market leader in the supply chain management and omnichannel software solutions market as defined by industry analysts such as ARC Advisory Group and Gartner.

      "Maintenance relates to our legacy perpetual license sales. We expect maintenance revenues to decline as we continue to develop our cloud offerings, and be offset by additional cloud revenue, including from customers converting their maintenance contracts to cloud subscriptions. The growth of maintenance revenues is influenced by: (1) new software license contracts; (2) annual renewal of support contracts; and (3) fluctuations in currency rates. Substantially all of our customers renew their annual support contracts or convert their maintenance contracts to cloud subscriptions. Maintenance revenue is generally paid in advance and recognized over the term of the agreement, typically twelve months. Maintenance renewal revenue is recognized over the renewal period once we have a contract upon payment from the customer. \n",

Professional services are sometimes rendered under fixed-fee based contracts with payments due on specific dates or milestones. \n",

      "We have three reportable segments: the Americas, EMEA, and APAC. Revenue information is based on the location of sale. The revenues represented below are from external customers only. The geography-based expenses include costs of personnel, direct sales, marketing expenses, and general and administrative costs to support the business. There are certain corporate expenses included in the Americas segment that we do not charge to the other segments including research and development, certain marketing and general and administrative costs that support the global organization, and the amortization of acquired developed technology. Included in the Americas costs are all research and development costs, including the costs associated with our operations in India.

      "Cloud subscriptions revenue increased $82.6 million to $337.2 million in 2024 compared to 2023. Our customers have demonstrated a clear preference for cloud-based solutions, including existing customers that are migrating from on-premise to cloud-based offerings. Cloud subscriptions revenue increased $58.7 million, $20.6 million and $3.3 million for the Americas, EMEA, and APAC segments, respectively. Cloud subscriptions revenue recognized from first time cloud customers (defined as customers with no prior cloud subscriptions) during the year in which their initial cloud subscription began was approximately 2% and 3% of total cloud revenue in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our customers contract for multi-year subscriptions which typically increase in scope and price over the term, and thus revenue recognized during the year when the contract is signed tends to be small relative to the total contract value. Revenue recognized in the initial year excludes revenue from additional solutions sold to the customer in future years and could be impacted by the timing of the start date of the subscription during the year.\n",

Professional services revenue recognized from first time cloud customers (defined as customers with no prior cloud subscriptions) during the year in which their initial cloud subscription began was approximately 7% and 8% of total services revenue in 2024 and 2023, respectively. As with our cloud subscriptions, customers often continue to purchase our professional services beyond their initial implementation to roll out additional locations, implement additional features and functionality, and implement additional products, as well as for general support. Professional services revenue recognized from first time cloud customers excludes those services we provided after the year in which the initial cloud subscription began.

Conditions to our obligations generally include that we are provided the right to control the defense of the claims and, in general, to control settlement negotiations. Those provisions generally provide also that, if the customer is prevented from using our services or products because of a third party infringement claim, our sole obligation (in addition to the indemnification, defense, and hold harmless obligation referred to above) is to, at our expense, (i) procure for the customer the right to continue to use the services or products, (ii) replace or modify the services or products so that the customer’s use does not infringe, or, if neither of those options is reasonably feasible, terminate that particular services or products and provide, as applicable, a refund of services fees paid for services not received or a refund of the unamortized portion of the license fees paid for the products (based on a five year amortization period). Our customer contracts sometimes also require us to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the customer in connection with death, personal injury or property damage claims made by third parties with respect to actions of our personnel or contractors. The indemnity obligations contained in our customer contracts generally have no specified expiration date and no specified monetary limitation on liability, but they do not cover indirect or consequential damages, such as our customers’ lost revenues or profits. We have not previously incurred costs to settle claims or pay awards under these indemnification obligations. We account for these indemnity obligations in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's guidance on accounting for contingencies and record a liability for these obligations when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.

We believe that the estimates, judgments, and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based on information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments, and assumptions are made. To the extent there are material differences between those estimates, judgments, or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected.

Implementation services include system planning, design, configuration, testing, and other software implementation support, and are typically optional and distinct from our software. Following implementation, customers may purchase application managed services to support and maintain our software. Fees for our services are separately priced and are generally billed on an hourly basis, and revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed. In certain situations, we render professional services under agreements based upon a fixed fee for portions of or all of the engagement. Revenue related to fixed-fee-based services contracts is recognized over time based on the proportion performed.\n",

      "Our cloud customer contracts can include the sale of SaaS and services. Judgment is required to determine whether each service or product sold is a distinct performance obligation that should be accounted for separately. We allocate the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations based on relative standalone selling price (“SSP”). We estimate SSP based on the prices we charge our customers or by using other information such as market conditions and other observable inputs. The selling price of our cloud subscriptions are highly variable. Thus, we estimate SSP for cloud subscriptions using the residual approach, determined based on total transaction price less the SSP of other goods and services promised in the contract.\n",

We recognized foreign exchange losses of $1.0 million in 2024, compared to losses of $1.5 million in 2023, and gains of $4.7 million in 2022. Foreign exchange rate transaction gains and losses are classified in “Other (loss) income, net” in our Consolidated Statements of Income. A fluctuation of 10% in the period end exchange rates at December 31, 2024 relative to the U.S. dollar would have resulted in a change of approximately $5.6 million in the reported foreign currency loss. \n",

      "We currently invest our cash and cash equivalents in a variety of financial instruments, including taxable floating rate obligations in money market funds and certificate of deposits with original maturities of less than three months when purchased. These investments are mainly denominated in U.S. dollars. Cash balances in foreign currencies overseas, except for India, are derived from business operations. Our operations in India are funded by the U.S. operations. At December 31, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents balances totaled $266.2 million, of which all is highly liquid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest-earning instruments carry interest rate risks. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates, or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. The weighted-average interest rate of return on cash equivalents and short-term investments was approximately 2% and 2% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The fair value of cash equivalents held at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $93.8 million and $86.2 million, respectively. Based on the average cash equivalents and short-term investments outstanding during 2024 and 2023, increases or decreases in the rates of return of 25 basis points would result in increases or decreases to interest income of approximately $0.7 million and $0.6 million from the reported interest income for 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n",

      "Manhattan Associates, Inc. (“Manhattan”, the “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) is a developer and provider of supply chain commerce solutions that help organizations optimize the effectiveness, efficiency, and strategic advantages of their supply chains. Our solutions consist of software, services, and hardware, which coordinate people, workflows, assets, events, and tasks holistically across the functions linked in a supply chain from planning through execution. These solutions also help coordinate the actions, data exchange, and communication of participants in supply chain ecosystems, such as manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, trading partners, transportation providers, channels (such as catalogers, store retailers, and Web outlets), and consumers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our operations are in North and South America (the “Americas\"), Europe (EMEA), and the Asia/Pacific (APAC) region. The Americas operation are conducted through the Parent Company, Manhattan Associates, Inc., and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Manhattan Associates Chile Spa. Our European and Asia Pacific operations are conducted through wholly owned subsidiaries within their respective geographies. We occasionally sell our products and services in other countries, such as countries in Latin America, Eastern Europe, Middle East, and Asia, through our direct sales channel as well as various reseller channels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Risks Associated with Single Business Line, Technological Advances, and Foreign Operations \n",
      "\n",
      "We currently derive a substantial portion of our revenues from sales of cloud solutions and related services. The markets for supply chain commerce solutions are highly competitive, subject to rapid technological change, changing customer needs, frequent new product introductions, and evolving industry standards that may render existing products and services obsolete. As a result, our position in these markets could be eroded rapidly by unforeseen changes in customer requirements for application features, functions, and technologies. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business, including, but not limited to, differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility. We recognized foreign exchange losses of $1.0 million in 2024, compared to losses of $1.5 million in 2023, and gains of $4.7 million in 2022. Foreign exchange rate transaction gains and losses are classified in “Other (loss) income, net” on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n",
      "\n",
      " In addition, we have a large development center in Bangalore, India, that does not have a natural in-market revenue hedge to mitigate currency risk to our operating expenses in India. Fluctuations in the value of other currencies, particularly the Indian Rupee, could significantly affect our expenses, operating profit and net income. \n",
      "\n",
      "Principles of Consolidation and Foreign Currency Translation \n",
      "\n",
      "The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. \n",
      "\n",
      "The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries have been translated into United States dollars in accordance with the foreign currency matters topic in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (the “Codification”). Revenues and expenses from international operations were denominated in the respective local currencies and translated using the average monthly exchange rates for the year. All balance sheet accounts have been translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and the effect of changes in exchange rates from year to year are disclosed as a separate component of shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income. \n",

      "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n",
      "\n",
      "Cash and Cash Equivalents \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "51\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Concentrations of Credit Risk \n",
      "\n",
      "Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. We maintain cash and cash equivalents with various financial institutions. Amounts held are above the federally insured limit. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our sales are primarily to companies located in the United States, Europe and Asia. We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and do not require collateral. Accounts receivable are due principally from large U.S., European and Asia Pacific companies under stated contract terms. Accounts receivable, net as of December 31, 2024 for the Americas, EMEA, and APAC segments were $144.8 million, $50.6 million, and $10.1 million, respectively. Accounts receivable, net as of December 31, 2023 for the Americas, EMEA, and APAC segments were $137.2 million, $34.6 million, and $9.4 million, respectively. Our top five customers in aggregate accounted for 12%, 11%, and 11% of total revenue recognized for each of the years ended December 31, 2024 (“2024”), the year ended December 31, 2023 (“2023”), and the year ended December 31, 2022 (“2022”), respectively. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue in 2024, 2023 and 2022, or more than 10% of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fair Value Measurement \n",
      "\n",
      "We measure our investments based on a fair value hierarchy disclosure framework that prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring assets and liabilities at fair value. Market price observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of asset or liability and their characteristics. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows: \n",
      "\n",
      "•\n",
      "Level 1–Quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments. \n",
      "•\n",
      "Level 2–Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets. \n",
      "•\n",
      "Level 3–Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. \n",
      "Investments with maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents; investments with maturities of greater than 90 days from the date of purchase but less than one year are generally classified as short-term investments; and investments with maturities of one year or greater from the date of purchase are generally classified as long-term investments. Unrealized holding gains and losses are reflected as a net amount in a separate component of shareholders’ equity until realized. For the purposes of computing realized gains and losses, cost is determined on a specific identification basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "At December 31, 2024, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents were $172.4 million and $93.8 million, respectively. Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid money market funds of $83.9 million and certificates of deposit of $9.9 million. For money market funds, we use quoted prices from active markets that are classified as Level 1, the highest level of observable input in the disclosure hierarchy framework. The Company had no investments at December 31, 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and accounts payable included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets approximate their fair values principally due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. \n",
      "\n",
      "Use of Estimates \n",
      "\n",
      "The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates include the allowance for credit losses, which is based upon an evaluation of historical amounts written-off, the customers’ ability to pay, and general economic conditions; self-insurance accruals; impairment testing of goodwill; and our effective income tax rate (including the impact of unrecognized tax benefits) and deferred tax assets, which are based upon our expectations of future taxable income, allowable deductions, and projected tax credits. Actual results will differ from these estimates. \n",

      "\n",
      "Revenue Recognition \n",
      "\n",
      "We recognize revenue when we transfer control of the promised products or services to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those products or services. We derive our revenue from cloud subscriptions, software licenses, customer support services and software enhancements (“maintenance”) for software licenses, professional services, and sales of hardware. We exclude sales and usage-based taxes from revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nature of Products and Services\n",
      "\n",
      "Cloud subscriptions includes software as a service (“SaaS”) and arrangements which provide customers with the right to use our software within a cloud environment that we provide and manage where the customer does not have the right to take possession of the software without significant penalty. SaaS and hosting revenues are recognized over the contract period.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Our services revenue consists of fees generated from implementation, training and application managed services, including reimbursements of out-pocket expenses in connection with our implementation services. Implementation services include system planning, design, configuration, testing, and other software implementation support, and are typically optional and distinct from our software. Following implementation, customers may purchase application managed services to support and maintain our software. Fees for our services are separately priced and are generally billed on an hourly basis, and revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed. In certain situations, we render professional services under agreements based upon a fixed fee for portions of or all of the engagement. Revenue related to fixed-fee-based services contracts is recognized over time based on the proportion performed.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We provide maintenance services, to customers who have previously purchased a perpetual license, that include a comprehensive 24 hours per day, 365 days per year program that provides customers with software upgrades, when and if available, which include additional or improved functionality and technological advances incorporating emerging supply chain and industry initiatives. Maintenance contracts typically only have one performance obligation. Revenue related to maintenance is generally paid in advance and recognized over the term of the agreement, typically twelve months. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our perpetual software licenses provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists at the time of purchase. We recognize revenue for distinct software licenses once the license period has begun and we have made the software available to the customer. The selling price of our software licenses are highly variable. Thus, we estimate SSP for software licenses using the residual approach, determined based on total transaction price less the SSP of other goods and services promised in the contract.\n",
      "\n",

These products include computer hardware, radio frequency terminal networks, radio frequency identification (RFID) chip readers, bar code printers and scanners, and other peripherals.

      "Our cloud contracts with customers can include the sales of SaaS and services. Judgment is required to determine whether each product and service is considered to be a distinct performance obligation that should be accounted for separately under the contract. We allocate the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations based on relative standalone selling price (“SSP”). We estimate SSP based on the prices charged to customers, or by using information such as market conditions and other observable inputs. The selling price of our cloud subscriptions are highly variable. Thus, we estimate SSP for our cloud subscriptions and using the residual approach, determined based on total transaction price less the SSP of other goods and services promised in the contract.\n",

      "Cloud subscriptions and maintenance for perpetual software licenses are typically billed annually in advance. Timing of invoicing to customers may differ from timing of revenue recognition. Payment terms for our software licenses vary. We have an established history of collecting under the terms of our software license contracts without providing refunds or concessions to our customers. Services are typically billed monthly as performed. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined that our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with predictable ways to purchase our software and services, not to provide or receive financing. Additionally, we are applying the practical expedient to exclude from consideration any contracts with payment terms of one year or less. We rarely offer terms extending beyond one year. \n",

Over 98% of our remaining performance obligations represent cloud native subscriptions with a non-cancelable term greater than one year (including cloud-deferred revenue as well as amounts we will invoice and recognize as revenue from our performance of cloud services in future periods). Maintenance contracts for perpetual software licenses are typically one year in duration and are not included in the remaining performance obligations. We expect to recognize revenue on approximately 40% of these remaining performance obligations over the next 24 months with the majority of the remaining balance recognized over the following 36 months.

Should any of these factors change, the estimates made by us will also change accordingly, which could affect the level of our future allowances. Additions to the allowance for credit losses are recorded in general and administrative expense and were immaterial in all periods presented.

We amortize these amounts over the expected benefit period which we estimate by considering several factors, including the rate of technological change and duration of our customer contracts. Sales commissions for renewal contracts are amortized over the related contractual renewal period. We apply the practical expedient to expense sales commissions when the amortization period would have been one year or less. Deferred commissions were $42.4 million as of December 31, 2024, of which $31.8 million is included in other assets and $10.6 million is included in prepaid expenses. Deferred commissions were $39.6 million as of December 31, 2023, of which $29.6 million is included in other assets and $10.0 million is included in prepaid expenses. Sales commission expense is included in Sales and Marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Amortization of sales commissions in 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $10.6 million, $9.8 million, and $7.5 million respectively. No impairment losses were recognized during 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n",

Under this guidance, computer software development costs are charged to research and development (R&D) expense until technological feasibility is established, after which remaining software production costs are capitalized. We have defined technological feasibility as the point in time at which we have a detailed program design or a working model of the related product, depending on the type of development efforts, and high-risk development issues have been resolved through end-to-end system testing.

If circumstances change or events occur to indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting units have fallen below their carrying amount, we would record an impairment charge based on that difference.

Conditions to our obligations generally include that we are provided the right to control the defense of the claims and, in general, to control settlement negotiations. Those provisions generally provide also that, if the customer is prevented from using our software because of a third party infringement claim, our sole obligation (in addition to the indemnification, defense, and hold harmless obligation referred to above) is to, at our expense, (i) procure for the customer the right to continue to use the software, (ii) replace or modify the product so that its use by the customer does not infringe, or, if either of the foregoing are not reasonably feasible, (iii) terminate the customer contract and provide a refund of the unamortized portion of the customer’s license fee (based on a five year amortization period). Our customer contracts sometimes also require us to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the customer in connection with death, personal injury, or property damage claims made by third parties with respect to actions of our personnel or contractors. The indemnity obligations contained in our customer contracts generally have no specified expiration date and no specified monetary limitation on liability. We have not previously incurred costs to settle claims or pay awards under these indemnification obligations. We account for these indemnity obligations in accordance with FASB guidance on accounting for contingencies, and record a liability for these obligations when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.

We also warrant to our customers that services will be performed consistent with generally accepted industry standards or specific service levels through completion of the agreed upon services. If necessary, we will provide for the estimated cost of product and service warranties based on specific warranty claims history.

Under this accounting pronouncement, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for the change in net deferred tax assets or liabilities resulting from events that are recorded for financial reporting purposes in a different reporting period than recorded in the tax return. Management must make significant assumptions, judgments, and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset. \n",

      "Our judgments, assumptions, and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws, allowable deductions, projected tax credits, and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. We do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. If the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. Changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our statement of financial position and our statements of income. Our assumptions, judgments, and estimates relative to the value of our net deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments, and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. \n",

Options and stock appreciation rights cannot have a term exceeding seven years. As of December 31, 2024, there were 2,337,032 shares available for issuance under the 2020 Plan.

We recognize compensation cost for service-based restricted awards with graded vesting on a straight-line basis over the entire vesting period, with the amount of compensation cost recognized at any date at least equal to the portion of the grant-date value of the award that is vested at that date. For our performance-based restricted stock awards with graded vesting, we recognize compensation cost on an accelerated basis applying straight-line expensing for each separately vesting portion of each award.

A valuation allowance of $1.6 million has been established for these credits because the ability to use them is not more likely than not.

      "We manage our business by geographic segment and have three geographic reportable segments: the Americas (North, Latin and South America); Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific (APAC). All segments derive revenue from the sale and implementation of our supply chain commerce solutions. The individual products sold by the segments are similar in nature and are all designed to help companies manage the effectiveness and efficiency of their supply chain commerce. We use the same accounting policies for each reportable segment. The chief operating decision maker (Chief Executive Officer) evaluates performance and allocates resources (including employees, financial or capital) based on operating income for each reportable segment. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Americas segment charges royalty fees to the other segments based on cloud subscriptions and software licenses sold by those reportable segments. The royalties, which totaled $18.9 million, $13.7 million, and $8.9 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, are included in costs of revenue for each segment with a corresponding reduction in the America’s cost of revenue. The revenues represented below are from external customers only. The geography-based costs consist of costs for professional services personnel, direct sales and marketing expenses, infrastructure costs to support the employee and customer base, billing and financial systems, management and general and administrative support. There are certain corporate expenses included in the Americas segment that we do not charge to the other segments. Such expenses include research and development, stock compensation, certain marketing and general and administrative costs that support the global organization, and the amortization of acquired developed technology. Costs in the Americas’ segment include all research and development costs including the costs associated with our operations in India. \n",
