# Error Logging and Monitoring

This document details the error logging and monitoring strategy for the platform.

## Logging Framework

*   We utilize the SLF4J logging facade with Logback as the underlying implementation.
*   Structured logging is employed using JSON format for easy parsing and analysis. Log fields include timestamp, log level, class name, method name, thread ID, and any relevant contextual data (e.g., user ID, request ID).
*   Log levels are categorized as TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, and ERROR. Production environments are configured to log at the INFO level and above.

## Log Aggregation and Analysis

*   Logs are aggregated using Fluentd and forwarded to Elasticsearch for indexing and storage.
*   Kibana is used for log analysis, visualization, and alerting.
*   Dashboards are configured to monitor key metrics such as error rates, response times, and system resource utilization.

## Monitoring Tools

*   **Prometheus:** Used for collecting and storing time-series data from various application components.
*   **Grafana:** Used for visualizing Prometheus metrics and creating dashboards.
*   **Alertmanager:** Used for configuring alerts based on Prometheus metrics. Alerts are sent via email, Slack, or PagerDuty.

## Error Reporting

*   **Sentry:** Integrated for real-time error tracking and reporting. Sentry captures stack traces, user context, and other relevant information to help diagnose and resolve errors quickly.

## Code Example (Logging)

```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class MyClass {
  private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyClass.class);

  public void myMethod(String input) {
    try {
      // Some code that might throw an exception
      int result = Integer.parseInt(input);
    } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
      logger.error("Invalid input: {}", input, e); // Structured logging example
    }
  }
}
