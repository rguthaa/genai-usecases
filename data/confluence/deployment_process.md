# Deployment Process

This document outlines the deployment process for the platform.

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipeline

*   We utilize a CI/CD pipeline based on Jenkins and Docker.
*   Code changes are committed to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
*   Jenkins automatically builds and tests the code upon each commit.
*   If the tests pass, Jenkins creates a Docker image and pushes it to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR).
*   The Docker image is then deployed to the target environment (e.g., development, staging, production) using Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.

## Deployment Environments

*   **Development:** Used for rapid prototyping and experimentation. Deploys are automated and occur frequently.
*   **Staging:** Used for testing and QA. Closely mirrors the production environment. Deploys are performed before each production release.
*   **Production:** The live environment used by end-users. Deploys are carefully planned and executed.

## Deployment Strategies

*   **Blue/Green Deployment:** Used for zero-downtime deployments in production. Two identical environments (blue and green) are maintained. Traffic is switched from the blue environment to the green environment after the new version has been deployed and tested.
*   **Canary Deployment:** Used to gradually roll out a new version to a small subset of users before rolling it out to the entire user base. This allows us to monitor the impact of the new version and identify any issues before they affect a large number of users.

## Rollback Procedure

*   In the event of a failed deployment, we have a rollback procedure in place to quickly revert to the previous version.
*   Rollbacks are automated and can be triggered manually or automatically based on monitoring metrics.

## Code Example (Dockerfile)

```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY target/*.jar app.jar

EXPOSE 8080

ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
