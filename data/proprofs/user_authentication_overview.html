<h1>Keeping Your Account Safe</h1>

<p>Your account security is important to us!  This guide explains how we protect your information and what you can do to keep your account secure.</p>

<h2>Logging In Securely</h2>

<p>You'll need your email address and password to log in.  Here's how to keep your password safe:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Choose a strong password:</b> Use a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.</li>
  <li><b>Don't share your password:</b> Keep it secret!</li>
  <li><b>Keep your password updated:</b>  Change it regularly.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Two-Step Verification (Highly Recommended!)</h2>

<p>We strongly recommend using two-step verification for extra security. It adds a second layer of protection. Here's how it works:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You enter your password as usual.</li>
  <li>We send a code to your phone (via text or an app).</li>
  <li>You enter that code to finish logging in.</li>
</ol>
<p>Even if someone knows your password, they can't log in without that code from your phone!</p>
<p>You can turn it on in your account settings, under "Security."</p>

<h2>What if I forget my Password?</h2>
<p>Click on "Forgot Password", and follow the prompts.</p>

<h2>Why is this important?</h2>

<p>Two-step verification makes it much harder for anyone to access your account without your permission.</p>
