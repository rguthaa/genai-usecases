<h1>Information About Our System (For Advanced Users)</h1>

<p>This page is for users who connect to our platform using APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).  Most users won't need this information.</p>

<h2>What's an API?</h2>

<p>An API allows different computer systems to talk to each other.  If you use tools that connect to our platform automatically, they're probably using our API.</p>

<h2>Keeping the API Up-to-Date</h2>

<p>We update our API regularly with new features and improvements. We always transition to new versions smoothly.</p>

<h2>What This Means For You</h2>

<p>If you're using our API, we'll let you know about any important changes in advance, along with instructions for updating your connection. Old API's will exist for a time for migration.</p>
